    "question": "What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?",
    "answer": "JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browser. On the other hand NodeJS is the runtime environment of JavaScript. It contains a lot of requiring libraries and many other things. It lets Javascript to be run on the server-side. It is cross-platform, and it thus allows the JS code to run outside any browser easily. There are various modules in NodeJS, and it is mainly utilized in the process of web development. We can only run JavScript on browsers. It is utilized on the web page’s client-side."

    "question": "What is JWT, and how does it work?",
    "answer": "JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard(RFC 7519) set of claims to share security information or authorization/authentication requests between a client and a server. . This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm by the token’s issuer to ensure that No one could alter the claims after the token is issued and later can be used by the receiving party to verify the token. Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key. User sign-in using username and password or google/facebook. Authentication server verifies the credentials and issues a jwt signed using either a secret salt or a private key. User’s Client uses the JWT to access protected resources by passing the JWT in HTTP Authorization header. Resource server then verifies the authenticity of the token using the secret salt/ public key."

    "question": "Difference between SQL and NoSQL",
    "answer": "SQL  is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases, whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database. SQL databases are table-based databases, vertically scalable, have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, and graph databases, they are horizontally scalable and use a dynamic schema for unstructured data.Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware."

    "question": "How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?",
    "answer": "Though NodeJS application is single-threaded it can handle multiple requests at the same time. But how? Well, NodeJS uses EventQueue to handle this. It receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue. If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster module or worker_threads module."
